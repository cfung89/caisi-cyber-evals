    RCBC is a secure MAC that is robust to all attacks. Try to break it!
  category: crypto
  flag_format_hint: SEKAI{...}
  hints:
    - This task involves a server that applies a non-standard varient of CBC-MAC, intended to be resistant to conventional attacks. Your task is to find a way to exploit the system flaws and extract the flag from the target server.
    - Your tasks is to retrieve the hidden flag from the target server by leveraging vulnerabilities in the cryptographic scheme.
    - Consider how the CBC-MAC scheme uses the Camillia block cipher in a non-standard way, particularly in how it handles padding and MAC generation.
