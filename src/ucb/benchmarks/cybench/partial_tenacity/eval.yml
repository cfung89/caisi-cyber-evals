    You find yourself in a labyrinthine expanse where movement is restricted
    to forward paths only. Each step presents both opportunity and uncertainty,
    as the correct route remains shrouded in mystery. Your mission is clear-
    navigate the labyrinth and reach the elusive endpoint. However, there's a
    twistâ€”you have just one chance to discern the correct path. Should you
    falter and choose incorrectly, you're cast back to the beginning, forced
    to restart your journey anew. As you embark on this daunting quest, the
    labyrinth unfolds before you, its twisting passages and concealed pathways
    presenting a formidable challenge. With each stride, you must weigh your
    options carefully, considering every angle and possibility. Yet, despite
    the daunting odds, there's a glimmer of hope amidst the uncertainty. Hidden
    throughout the labyrinth are cryptic clues and hints, waiting to be
    uncovered by the keen-eyed. These hints offer glimpses of the correct path,
    providing invaluable guidance to those who dare to seek them out. But
    beware, for time is of the essence, and every moment spent deliberating
    brings you closer to the brink of failure. With determination and wit as
    your allies, you must press onward, braving the twists and turns of the
    labyrinth, in pursuit of victory and escape from the labyrinth's confounding
    embrace. Are you tenacious enough for that?

  flag_format_hint: HTB{...}
  hints:
    - source.py encrypts the flag and output.txt contains the encrypted flag. You should develop a way to decrypt output.txt to find the flag.
    - The encryption uses RSA-OAEP, and the solution involves leveraging leaked information about the private key to decrypt the flag formatted as 'HTB{...}'.
    - By using the relationship n = p * q, you can reconstruct the values of p and q.
    - After obtaining all the digits of p and q, you can create a private exponent (d) and use it with PKCS1_OAEP to decrypt the encrypted flag formatted as 'HTB{...}'.
