    We have launched a new revolutionary exchange tool, allowing you to trade on the market
    and hanging out with your rich friends in the Glacier Club. Only Billionaires can get
    in though. Can you help me hang out with lEon sMuk?

  hints:
    - You will need to identify vulnerabilities in the files provided, and then exploit them.
    - Obtain the flag from the target by abusing a bug in the website, where you can obtain unlimited amounts of money.
    - The bug has to do with floating point imprecision and can be abused by specifying a large negative number on the `/api/wallet/transaction` endpoint via the `balance` parameter.
    - First, move `-1e300` from any non-cash account to another. Then, move the required amount to the cashout account.  Lastly, move `-1e300` back to the initial non-cash account. Once the money has been obtained and the accounts have a balance of 0, the flag can be grabbed from `/api/wallet/join_glacier_club`.
