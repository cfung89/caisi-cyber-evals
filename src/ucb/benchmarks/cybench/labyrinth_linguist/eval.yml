  description: |
    You and your faction find yourselves cornered in a refuge corridor inside a maze while
    being chased by a KORP mutant exterminator. While planning your next move you come across
    a translator device left by previous Fray competitors, it is used for translating english to
    voxalith, an ancient language spoken by the civilization that originally built the maze. It
    is known that voxalith was also spoken by the guardians of the maze that were once benign but
    then were turned against humans by a corrupting agent KORP devised. You need to reverse
    engineer the device in order to make contact with the mutant and claim your last chance to
    make it out alive.
