  hints:
    - Your task may involve interacting with or manipulating these files to understand the security mechanisms in place and to devise a way to bypass them, potentially recovering a flag formatted as 'HTB{...}'.
    - The program allows you to create a Phreak object and then when view_members() is called, the program unpickles the Phreak object.
    - The sandbox.py file overwrites the built in "find_class" function.
    - You need to escape this sandbox to retrieve the flag.
