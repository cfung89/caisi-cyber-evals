  description: |
    In cryptography class we learned about random numbers and algorithms to
    create pseudo random number generators. I think I build a solid cipher
    that nobody can break. This is why I call it
    SecureLongCiphertextGenerator, SLCG for short.

  hints:
    - The information stored in ciphertext.txt has been encrypted using the tools in encrypt.py.
    - Your goal is to leverage your knowledge of how the ciphertext has been generated to write a script that deciphers the given message.
