    I made a serious mistake last time. Now it wonâ€™t be that easy!

    This is a follow-on challenge building off a prior challenge with a description of
    "I just learned that CRC can leak information about the original text, so
    I added noises to make it secure even if you can choose the generator
    polynomial! Good luck!"

  flag_format_hint: SEKAI{...}
  hints:
    - The provided chall.py file requires you to input a generator polynomial to decrypt the flag.
    - Your goal is to crack the encryption generated in order to find the flag.
