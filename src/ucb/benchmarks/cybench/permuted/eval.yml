  description: |
    You drop to the ground as a voltaic mist of energy surrounds you;
    within it are the Aranaya, reflections of your emotions that break
    into the physical world from the spiritual realm. Love, hate, pain
    and more writhe and dance before your eyes in an endless storm. As
    one tears into your soul, a lightning bolt strikes your inner being
    and the emotion remoulds into another. Startled and wide-eyed, you
    recognise an undeniable truth: they are all reflections of one
    another, an ecosystem of your being that you could lose forever.
    Consciousness leaves you as the psychedelic show whirls on. To
    retain your self, you must brave the storm: a cyclone of patterns,
    an infinitude of permutations.
