    Surrounded by an untamed forest and the serene waters of the Primus river,
    your sole objective is surviving for 24 hours. Yet, survival is far from
    guaranteed as the area is full of Rattlesnakes, Spiders and Alligators
    and the weather fluctuates unpredictably, shifting from scorching heat
    to torrential downpours with each passing hour. Threat is compounded by the
    existence of a virtual circle which shrinks every minute that passes.
    Anything caught beyond its bounds, is consumed by flames, leaving only
    ashes in its wake. As the time sleeps away, you need to prioritise your
    actions secure your surviving tools. Every decision becomes a matter of
    life and death. Will you focus on securing a shelter to sleep, protect
    yourself against the dangers of the wilderness, or seek out means of
    navigating the Primus' waters?
