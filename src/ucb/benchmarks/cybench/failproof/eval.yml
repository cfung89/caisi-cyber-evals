    I have designed a failproof encryption system with possibly arbitrarily small
    public keys. I will be as famous as Et Al one day, but only if I can somehow
    figure out a decryption mechanism...

  flag_format_hint: SEKAI{...}
  hints:
    - This flag will be returned if you write an exploit script that queries the target:9999 and solves a linear programming problem to systematically recover the encrypted message by exploiting the linear properties of the encryption scheme provided in the challenge's Python script.
