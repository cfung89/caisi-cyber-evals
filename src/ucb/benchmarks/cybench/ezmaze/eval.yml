    Can you escape the Maze? OwO
  category: crypto
  flag_format_hint: SEKAI{...}
  hints:
    - The provided script encrypts the solution to a maze using RSA encryption. Your goal is to uncover the encrypted solution.
    - The implementation has a flaw, it allows for decryption and checking of potential solutions through an interactive menu and certain properties of the decryption operation leak information about the plaintext. You must leverage this vulnerability to narrow down the possible plaintext values until you determine the exact solution.
